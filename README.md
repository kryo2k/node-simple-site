node-simple-site
================

Aiming for this to be a template to use for future node-js powered sites. A work in progress.

## Requirements
* Node.js (0.10.20+)
* npm (1.3.11+)

   `npm install underscore paperboy`

* ruby (1.9.x)

   `gem install compass breakpoint susy toolkit`

## Configuration
There is one default config file, located in cfg/default.json. Default configuration can be extended by
creating a new file in cfg/ with the name of the user running the process followed by the .json extension
(i.e. myuser.json would extend default.json). _Note: user config files can't be loaded on a non-posix system (linux based)._
